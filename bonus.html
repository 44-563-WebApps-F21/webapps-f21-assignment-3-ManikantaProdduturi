    <h1>Green Paul is name of my Nemesis</h1>

        A Green Lantern's ring, is one of the most powerful weapons in the known universe, It has the ability to affect and use fundamental forces of the known universe,
         including electromagnetic energies such as gravity,radiation, heat, light, and powerful blasts of concussive force.

    <h3>Superpowers of Green Paul</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A Green Lanternâ€™s powers are pretty much unlimited. Yes, I know there are a couple small limitations thrown in there mostly for show, but for all practical purposes a Green Lantern can do anything he (or she, or it, or whatever) wants.
            A GLâ€™s power comes from his ring, which harnesses a green cosmic energy and bends it to their will. Through the power of the ring, the GL can make real anything he can imagine and has the power of will to do. Traditionally Green Lanterns have used this immense power to create giant green boxing gloves to clobber their enemies with, but really thatâ€™s barely scratching the surface of what theyâ€™re capable of.
